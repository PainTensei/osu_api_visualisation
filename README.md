# osu_api_visualisation
trying to play around with the osu! API.


### Week 1
Goals: Connect to an API and understand how it works.

I started learning what an API exactly is, thanks to LinkedIn Learning and The Coding Train on youtube.
I followed a detailed guide how to connect to an API and stumbled upon a lot of errors and coding mistakes while doing so. 
I asked help from people in the osu! community who knew more than me about the API (because they worked with it before) and I asked a
Fontys teacher to help me displaying the right data I wanted to display.

### week 2
Goals:
- play around with the possible data
- make a random visualisation of any data with the API.

First thing first is deciding what tool I am going to use to visualise the data. I have multiple options and i will try as many as I 
can before deciding which one to use.
After that I will make some random default graphs to test out the possibilties.

### Week 3
Goals:
- Decide which data I want to use 
- make a meaningfull visualisation

I will decide which data I want to use to make a meaningfull visualisation.
